    <p class="bodywidth" style="text-align: left">	A light flashes across the machine monitor. The Programmer, having been fast asleep, is startled awake to see that his creation has finally started. He watches on in awe as the first few splashes of green slide across the screen. Now absorbed into the Program, he starts typing different values and variables into the machine. The green starts to be mixed more colors now: there's deep vibrant blues, bright yellows, dark blotches of red. Slowly the Program has rendered a meadow, with birds overhead singing their songs that sound as if they've been sung for ages. The sun is shining through the leaves, casting shadows upon the squirrel, foraging for food, chattering the whole time. There is a herd of deer grazing in the center of the meadow, with a few of their buck leaders watching over them making sure they are safe. There are flowers spread everywhere, showing off all the vibrant colors of this world. The Programmer is pleased with himself, he has created an amazing world of sight and sound. That's when he realized, he could add so much more. Exclaiming in delight, he starts adding more and more variables. Suddenly the smell of the meadow fills the room. He could smell each and every flower, he hears the brook, bubbling as it goes through the meadow. A few more variables and suddenly the trees have fruit. He instructs the Program to get closer to it. Being able to smell the fruit so precisely, he can almost imagine the taste and then realizes he has made himself hungry just from smelling it. He steps back to examine his work, watching the animals within their own little paradise world. He smiles to himself, happy that he was able to create such a beautiful world.</p>
